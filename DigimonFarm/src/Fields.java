/*Describe inheritance and its benefits: Inheritance in Java is a mechanism in which one 
 * object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It is an important part of 
 * OOPs (Object Oriented programming system). The idea behind inheritance in Java is that you can create 
 * new classes that are built upon existing classes. When you inherit from an existing class, you can 
 * reuse methods and fields of the parent class. Moreover, you can add new methods and fields in your 
 * current class also.*/
